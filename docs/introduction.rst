bsedata is a library for collecting real-time data from Bombay Stock Exchange (India). It can be used in various types of projects which require getting live quotes for a given stock or index or build large data sets for data analysis.

    The data provided by APIs is only as correct as provided on https://m.bseindia.com

    If you are facing any issue with the APIs then it may be beacuse there had been some format change recently in the way BSE reports its live quotes. Please upgrade to the latest version in order to avoid this issue. Report the issue at https://github.com/sdabhi23/bsedata/issues if it is not resolved even after upgrading the version.
